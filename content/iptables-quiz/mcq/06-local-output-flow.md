# Local Application Packet Traversal

## Question
A packet generated by a local application needs to reach an external server. Which chains does it traverse?

## Options
A) OUTPUT → POSTROUTING
B) INPUT → OUTPUT → POSTROUTING
C) OUTPUT → FORWARD → POSTROUTING
D) PREROUTING → OUTPUT → POSTROUTING

## Answer
A

## Explanation
Packets generated by local processes go through the OUTPUT chain first (in the filter table), then through POSTROUTING (where SNAT/masquerading can occur) before leaving the network interface. There is no INPUT or PREROUTING involved because the packet originates locally, and FORWARD is only for packets being routed through the system.

## Hook
If you have both OUTPUT filter rules and POSTROUTING nat rules, which one gets evaluated first? Why does this order matter?
